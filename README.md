# Podcast Project

Welcome to the Podcast project! This repository contains the source code of a web application developed using Vite, a rapid development environment for JavaScript web applications. Also the libraries React-router-dom, Material ui , Redux with RTKQuery and Jest were used.

## Description

A project is proposed that connects to the iTunes API to retrieve the top 100 podcasts. To accomplish this, the project will use the iTunes API to perform a search in the podcast category and then select the top 100 results based on the number of plays.

In addition to displaying the top 100 most popular podcasts, the project will offer users the opportunity to listen to an excerpt of the podcast, read a brief description of the topic covered and meet the presenter. In addition, users will have the option to subscribe to the podcast via a link that will take them directly to iTunes.

Finally, the project will be designed with a responsive approach, meaning that it will be optimized for use on a variety of devices and screens. This functionality will allow users to access the top 100 podcasts from anywhere and at any time. In short, this project will be a useful tool for podcast lovers who want to explore the best podcasts from around the world.

## Features

- Default Vite configuration for quick start.
- Support for modern JavaScript (ES6+).
- Integration with React (or any other library of your choice).
- Hot-reloading support for a smooth development experience.
- Optimized bundling for production with minified and optimized code generation.
- Routing management support using React Router (or an alternative of your preference).
